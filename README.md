# An experimental text to wallet inspired by LiquidStar.io

This is a USSD based Ethereum wallet. Users can easily interact with their wallet by dialing a USSD code. Africa is yet to achieve the high speed internet experienced in developed countries. USSD
offer's reliable instant messaging services in both urban and rural areas with GSM signals.

## The Challenge

Some of the major challengies hindering the adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrencies are;

-   Securities
-   Steep learning curve

What if we can tackle the issue of steep learning curve by adopting to the technology users have gained mastery of. In africa USSD is a major self-service channel that promises ultra fast time to
response.

This services are well utilized in the banking industry and often works well even when the banks mobile banking apps failed.

## The Solution

What if we can utilize USSD and SMS for users to manage their Ethereum wallet, mapping users wallet adddress to phone numbers offering users the simplicity of transacting with a more human readable
phone number than a long giberish address.

The above may raise some privacy issues but that is not much of our concerns

## Further development

We plan on developing this idea further to an enterprise grade but open source, this will allow more deployments and utilization.

To further enable merchants who will be utilizing this project in their technology stack accept micropayments which is currently not feasible on the L1 Ethereum network, we will be integrating with
some of the following L2 networks and bridges;

-   Harmony One
-   Polygon (MATIC)

Users will be able to select from which network they wish to interact with.
